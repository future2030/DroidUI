Droid UI
======================

A curated list Android UI/UX components.

## Why?
Do you ever wondered why we can't make a library with the commonly used Andorid UI components? If yes, you are in the right place. This is a library I made by copying hundreds of custom UI components from my own projects and other public projects. What is the advantage of doing so? here you go
* We only need one dependecy in our app to have all these amazing UI components. 
* If you want make a quick android app with common UI components, this is the best library you can have.
* For wireframing purpose, You can make an amazing wireframe design by using this kit
* You don't need to worry about individual UI libraries

OK, well. But what are the disadvantages
here you go
* I will not maintain the repo with up to date content everyday. You will get what is already there and that's all. I will add components only when I am going to use it. But don't worry, you can always fork and make your own version.


Thats OK. show me the list of components you have.
